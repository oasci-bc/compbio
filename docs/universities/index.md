Computational biology is a highly interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field, which inherently contradicts higher education, which is rife with bureaucracy, administrative bloat, and stagnant innovation.
Our research must be cutting-edge, but the overlap between passionate educators, administrators, and researchers needs to be improved.

Here, I survey academic programs specifically tailored to computational biology.
I intend to identify common themes in a recommended curriculum that makes students competitive for industry and graduate programs.
